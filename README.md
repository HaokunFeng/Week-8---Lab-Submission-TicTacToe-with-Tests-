# Week-8---Lab-Submission-TicTacToe-with-Tests-
This is the TECHIN509 homework of week 8

#The goal of this assignment is to add unit tests to the Tic Tac Toe game:

-All the tests should live in tests.py
-The tests should be run via the command line successfully, passing all tests
-Please add how to run your test in the README.md file in the Git repo, I should be able to run the tests in the command line by copy and pasting the command from your README.md
-You can use either unittest or pytest
-In writing the tests, you may need to consider refactoring your code to make it easier to test.
-As with code in general, where a test is not obvious to understand from the code, add documentation to describe it

#The tests should cover the following features
-The game is initialized with an empty board

-The game is initialized with either 2 players (human-human) or 1 player (human-bot)
-Players are assigned a unique piece to plays: X or O
-After one player plays, the other player has a turn
-All winning end of the games detected, and draw games are identified
-Players can play only in viable spots
-The correct game winner, if one exists, is detected
